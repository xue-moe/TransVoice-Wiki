# Voice Resource Repository 嗓音资源库
This project was started by Sumi and Emma. This is an open resource so if you have additions, suggestions or criticisms they are welcomed.
该项目是由Sumi和Emma发起的。这是一个开放的资源，因此欢迎您的补充、建议或批评。

## Mission Statement 目的
The main purpose of the collection is to provide approachable information and where possible, direction, so that people have what they need to at least get started on changing their voice. It's also designed to be used as a reference centre for if people need to provide context or help or definitions to people.
本项目的主要目的是提供简单易懂的信息，并在可能的情况下提供方向性指导，帮助人们至少能开始改变自己的嗓音。它也设计为一个参考中心，方便人们在需要为他人提供背景、帮助或定义时使用。
Basically, we want something a beginner can use as a guide to change their voice, and a reference material for students and teachers, to be as complete as possible and open to new information. The information provided should be the best we have available, and as with all information, should be questioned and updated over time to reflect that.
基本上，我们希望创建一个初学者可以用来作为嗓音改变指南的资源，同时也是学生和教师的参考资料。我们致力于让信息尽可能完整，并且开放接纳新信息。我们提供的信息应是当前最优的，并且像所有信息一样，应该随着时间的推移进行质疑和更新，以反映最新的认知。


This resource is still mostly feminisation oriented, which means most of the resources assume you want to make your voice more feminine, but there is work being done to make the resources mostly agnostic of your goals. There are also plenty of resources that are not specific to gendered voice but play a secondary part (such as [clarity](/wiki/pages/clarity)) and many of the exercises listed work in reverse with some minor alterations.
该资源目前仍然主要面向女性化嗓音，这意味着大多数资源假定用户希望让自己的嗓音更加女性化，但我们也正在努力使这些资源与您的目标无关。此外，还有许多并非特定于性别嗓音的资源（例如[清晰度](/wiki/pages/clarity)），它们在改变嗓音方面起到辅助作用，并且许多列出的练习可以通过一些微小的修改实现相反的效果。


Overall, the project aims to be an approachable yet informative source, and to be as complete as possible and open to new information. We want something a beginner can use as a guide to change their voice, and a reference material for students and teachers.
总体而言，本项目的目标是成为一个既有亲和力又信息丰富的资源，尽可能完整并开放接纳新信息。我们希望它既能成为初学者的嗓音改变指南，也能为学生和教师提供参考材料。


## What About Masculinisation Resources? 关于男性化资源？
Masculinisation resources are in the works, and we would love more input. The format we want is that for each gendered component of voice, we have a "getting more of this" header and a "getting less of this" header. This way, it doesn't matter if you're masculinising or feminising your voice, you can access the resources relevant for that goal. 
男性化资源正在筹备中，我们非常欢迎更多的意见和建议。我们希望采用的格式是，对于每个与性别相关的嗓音要素，提供一个“如何增加该要素”的标题和一个“如何减少该要素”的标题。这样，无论您是希望男性化还是女性化自己的嗓音，都可以找到与您目标相关的资源。

Pull requests are actually pretty easy. [Here's a slightly more complicated than it even needs to be article↗](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) about making changes with a pull request. Essentially, fork the repo, clone it (download it), make a new branch, make changes on the new branch and then go to the wiki page and make a new pull request using that branch.
其实pull request很简单。[这里有一篇稍微复杂一点的文章↗](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)，讲述了如何通过pull request进行更改。大致来说，fork仓库，克隆它（下载），创建一个新分支，在新分支上进行修改，然后回到wiki页面，使用该分支发起新的pull request。


If you seem to know what you're doing and don't want to impose your particular pedagogy onto the site, then we'll just give you permissions to modify and add pages.
